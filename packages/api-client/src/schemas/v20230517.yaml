      description: |
        Generate a downloadable snapshot with all blocked domains in order to check domains a user visits against a local blocklist, preserving their browsing privacy.

        **NOTE:** The Blocklist provides strictly worse protection against scam dApps than the [Blowfish Domains endpoint](https://docs.blowfish.xyz/reference/scan-domain). The Blocklist was created for a small minority of wallets where domain privacy is strictly more important than the best security. If you are newly integrating or testing Blowfish, we **highly recommend** using the [Domains endpoint](https://docs.blowfish.xyz/reference/scan-domain) to provide the best possible dApp security for your users.

        ### Integration
        This API enables to verify domain safety while maintaining the end user's privacy. To integrate this API into your app, you should follow the steps below:

        1. Regularly update the blocklist metadata from the `/v0/domains/blocklist` endpoint.
          - In browser extensions, set up a timer to update the blocklist every 2-5 minutes.
          - In mobile apps, update the blocklist each time the user opens the app and every 2-5 minutes while the user is using the app.
          - New values of `recentlyAdded` and `recentlyRemoved` should be stored after each update, regardless of whether the bloom filter has changed.
        2. During each update, check if the app has previously downloaded a bloom filter with the hash `bloomFilter.hash`. If not, download it from `bloomFilter.url`.
          - Since the bloom filter can be up to 1MB in size, make sure you never re-download the same bloom filter. Identical bloom filters always have the same URL and the same hash.
          - Store the blocklist metadata (`recentlyAdded`, `recentlyRemoved`), bloom filter hash, and downloaded bloom filter.
          - Chrome extensions can use localStorage. The endpoint is designed with a 5MB limit on localStorage in mind.
          - The bloom filter is changed once a day, so users will never use more than 1 MB of traffic per day if the download and local caching logic is implemented correctly.
        3. When the user visits a domain, check if the domain is present on the bloom filter or the `recentlyAdded` list from the blocklist metadata and isn't present on the `recentlyRemoved` list. If this is the case, block the user from visiting the website.

        Browser extensions and React Native apps can use the Javascript package [@blowfish/blocklist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blowfishxyz/blocklist) to implement the outlined logic. For example:

        ```js
        // Regular updates
        import { fetchDomainBlocklist, fetchDomainBlocklistBloomFilter } from '@blowfishxyz/blocklist';

        const blocklist = await fetchDomainBlocklist(apiConfig);
        [...] // save blocklist.recentlyAdded and blocklist.recentlyRemoved to a local database
        const storedHash = [...]; // fetch it from your storage
        if (storedHash != blocklist.bloomFilter.hash) {
            const bloomFilter = await fetchDomainBlocklistBloomFilter(blocklist.bloomFilter.url);
            [...] // save bloomFilter to a local database
            [...] // save bloomFilter.hash or blocklist.bloomFilter.hash to a local database
        }

        // Lookups
        import { scanDomain, Action } from '@blowfishxyz/blocklist';

        const recentlyAdded = [...]; // get from storage
        const recentlyRemoved = [...]; // get from storage
        const bloomFilter = [...]; // get from storage

        const action = scanDomain(
            bloomFilter,
            recentlyAdded,
            recentlyRemoved,
            "https://example.com/"
        );

        if (action === Action.BLOCK) {
            // block the domain
        }
        ```

        For more information on how to use the package, please refer to the NPM package description.

        ### Priority lists
        The API aggregates different proprietary Blowfish lists and ecosystem lists. In some cases, different lists may have conflicting data on whether to block or allow a domain. By providing `priorityBlockLists` and `priorityAllowLists`, you can override the results in these cases.

        If a domain is blocked by one of the lists that Blowfish aggregates, but included in one of `priorityAllowLists`, it will not be included in the blocklist snapshot. Conversely, if a domain is allow-listed by one of the lists that Blowfish aggregates, but is included in one of `priorityBlockLists`, it will be included in the snapshot.

        This is an advanced feature for integrators who want granular control over blocking domains. By default, the API uses internal list priority heuristics designed for most use cases. The Blowfish team continuously monitors the quality of the underlying blocklists and removes incorrect entries.

        Blowfish can also ingest custom blocklists and allowlists. If you have a custom list, you can reach out to the Blowfish team and provide a publicly available URL with the domains in a .txt format.

            A successful API response will include a link to download the bloom filter, which contains all blocked domains and any domains that were recently added to or removed from the filter.

            It's important to note that the recentlyAdded and recentlyRemoved fields take precedence over the bloom filter result.
            The bloom filter is updated every 24 hours by default (can be customized with `bloomFilterTtl` parameter. If new domains are added or removed, they will be listed in the recentlyAdded and recentlyRemoved fields until the bloom filter is updated.
            The bloom filter file, located at bloomFilter.url, is guaranteed to be less than 1 MB

        This endpoint allows to send additional data about user's behaviour after viewing a scanning result from Blowfish. For each scan, you can send events like `PROCEEDED` (when user decided to sign the transaction), `REJECTED` (when user decided to abort the transaction flow) and `REPORTED_MALICIOUS` (when user explicitly marked the submitted transaction as malicious).

        We review and analyze reports to improve the accuracy of our security engine.

        Scan a list of assets in order to receive recommended actions, tailored warnings and human-readable warnings and risk signals.

        Max amount of assets per request is 100.

        Assets can be NFTs or tokens and the format is:
        - EVM compatible NFTs: `{chain}:{network}:{collection_address}:{item_id}` 
          For example: `ethereum:mainnet:0x60e4d786628fea6478f785a6d7e704777c86a7c6:7330`

        - EVM compatible Tokens: `{chain}:{network}:{token_address}`
          For example: `ethereum:mainnet:0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7`

        - Solana assets: `solana:{network}:{address/pubkey}` 
          For example: `solana:mainnet:6eqgcVBG7PbQkjaRHnJ6YKGVEHCCFSKxXwx2WDLsxv6N`

        Possible values:
          - `BLOCK`: Show the user a block screen instead of the signing UI since this is highly likely to be a malicious transaction. We suggest still having a greyed out link allowing the user to proceed if they really think they know better
          - `WARN`: Show the user the supplied warnings.
          - `NONE`: Show the signing UI without modification.
      example: WARN

      description: An array of warnings generated from scanning the transactions. All
        these warnings won't be returned in a single response (some are mutually
        exclusive) but it is advisable that your UI can display multiple
        warnings. Warnings are returned sorted by severity, so if you can only
        show a user one warning, show them the one at the 0th index.

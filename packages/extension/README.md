# üê° Blowfish Protect üõ°

Blowfish Protect is a browser extension that wraps your Browser wallet's injected provider, intercepting any requests for the user to sign transactions or messages and scans them with Blowfish's security API. The user is then shown the scan and simulation results, allowing them to make an informed decision on whether they want to proceed with it to their wallet or not.

## üìö Getting Started

You can either develop UI components separately with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), or run the extenion in hot-reload development mode. Generally it's good to first develop the UI with mocked data with `Storybook component development`, and then hook up the UI to business logic in `Browser Extension development`

### üìñ Storybook component development

1. Copy `default.env` to `.env.development` and `.env.production`
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
1. Run `pnpm storybook`
1. Open `http://localhost:6006`
   - If you run into-issues you may need to use a different browser profile than the one you have Blowfish Protect install on
1. Start making changes to components and the storybook should automatically update with your changes
1. For more information refer to the [Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)

### üåê Browser Extension development

1. Copy `default.env` to `.env.development` and `.env.production`
   1. `PLASMO_PUBLIC_BLOWFISH_API_BASE_URL` Blowfish API URL
   2. `PLASMO_PUBLIC_BLOWFISH_WALLET_IMPERSONATION_AVAILABLE` can be used to impersonate an account in development
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
1. Run the local development environment with `pnpm dev`
1. Install `Metamask` into your Chrome browser. You can import our testing wallet seed phrase which is available in 1Password under `Seedphrase Development & Scam evaluation EVM`
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
1. Enable `Development Mode`
1. Click `Load unpacked`
1. Navigate into `build/chrome-mv3-dev` and click `Select`
1. Navigate to [https://app.uniswap.org/](https://app.uniswap.org/)
1. Connect your wallet and initiate a swap, Blowfish Protect should pop up showing you the transaction scan results, **don't confirm the tx in Metamask**
   - If something goes wrong right-click on the Blowfish Protect icon in Chrome, select `Inspect Popup` and look out for any error messages in the console.
1. Make changes to the codebase and the extension should reload automatically
   - At times the auto-reload can break and you will need to manually reload the Extension in `chrome://extensions`
1. For more information refer to the [Plasmo docs](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Running e2e tests locally
1. Start the application in development mode with `pnpm dev`
2. Run the e2e tests with `pnpm e2e`

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.

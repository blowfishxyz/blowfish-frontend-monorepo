                  <strong>Description</strong>. Our Service enables you to have
                  any blockchain transaction or message you are being prompted
                  to sign, scanned by us for potential fraud risk. Our Service
                  will provide you with metadata and warnings related to those
                  transactions or messages.
                </Li>
                <Li>
                  <strong>User Responsibility</strong>. While our Service may
                  help you to detect potential fraud, it is your ultimate
                  responsibility as a user to proceed with, or decline a
                  transaction, at your own risk, regardless of whether our
                  Service suspects potential fraudulent activity or not. You
                  should also keep in mind that a transaction may appear
                  suspicious but still be legitimate. You will be solely
                  responsible for any losses or damages resulting from your
                  decision to proceed or not proceed with a transaction.

                  create an account on Ninja Security&lsquo;s website to access
                  the Service. You will keep your credentials and all login
                  information related to your Ninja Security account secure. You
                  will not share your credentials or account login information
                  with any third party.

                  Service, including the number of calls to the Service that you
                  may make. Ninja Security may monitor your use of the Service
                  to ensure compliance with these limits, and to ensure quality,

                  the Service. You will use only the most recent version of the
                  Service unless Ninja Security provides advance written
                  approval otherwise. Your continued use of the Service

                  terminate your right to use the Service or these Customer
                  Terms if Ninja Security determines in its sole discretion that

                  not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The

# blowfish-frontend-monorepo âœ¨

This repo serves as a base for our frontend and frontend related Typescript code.

This is very much a work in progress âš  but the long term goal is that this will be a PNPM workspace monorepo that allows easy sharing of components and modules between all the frontend projects at Blowfish.

## ðŸ“š Getting started

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
2. Make sure your editor is setup to run [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
3. In the packages folder you will find the different projects

```shell
packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ extension               # Blowfish Protect browser extension
â”œâ”€â”€ extension-backend       # Thin Node proxy that sits between our extension and API
â””â”€â”€ extension-landing-page  # A basic Next.js app for https://extension.blowfish.xyz
```

4. Open the package you will be working on and refer to the README for package specific setup
5. âš  Please improve the documentation as you go. This is all very much **WIP**

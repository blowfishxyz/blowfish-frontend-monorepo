# blowfish-frontend-monorepo âœ¨

This repo serves as a base for our frontend and frontend related Typescript code.

This is very much a work in progress âš  but the long term goal is that this will be a PNPM workspace monorepo that allows easy sharing of components and modules between all the frontend projects at Blowfish.

## ðŸ“š Getting started

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
2. Make sure your editor is setup to run [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
3. How to:
   - install dependencies: `pnpm install`
   - run an app in dev mode: `pnpm dev --filter @blowfish/frontend-extension`
   - add a dependency: `pnpm add --filter @blowfish/frontend-extension react`
   - build a module: `pnpm build --filter @blowfish/utils`
   - add a dependency from one module to another: `pnpm add --filter @blowfish/frontend-extension @blowfish/utils --workspace`

4. Organization:
   - apps folder has all the apps 
   ```
   apps/
   â”œâ”€â”€ extension               # Blowfish Protect browser extension
   â”œâ”€â”€ extension-backend       # Thin Node proxy that sits between our extension and API
   â”œâ”€â”€ extension-landing-page  # A basic Next.js app for https://extension.blowfish.xyz 
   â””â”€â”€ transaction-portal      # NextJs App for the transaction portal
   ```
   - packages folder is used for all the shared modules
   ```
   packages/
   â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig                # Base tsconfig files to be used in other packages
   â””â”€â”€ utils                   # Shared utils
   ```
5. Open the package you will be working on and refer to the README for package specific setup
6. âš  Please improve the documentation as you go. This is all very much **WIP**
